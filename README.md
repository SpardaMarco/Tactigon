## Installation and Execution
In order to install and execute the game, you must download ***PFL_TP1_T03_Tactigon_4.ZIP*** and extract it. Then, inside the *src* directory, consult the ***main.pl*** file through SICStus Prolog 4.8. Finally, run the following command:
```prolog
?- play.
```
To improve the game experience, we recommend maximizing the SICStus Prolog window and changing the font as follows:
- Font: Consolas
- Style: Normal
- Size: 11

The game is available for Windows and Linux.

## Game Description

**Tactigon** is a board game for two players, played on an irregular hexagon board. Each player starts with 13 pieces. The game starts with a default board configuration, and the players take turns moving their pieces and resolving any combat that may result from that movement.

General movement rules:
- Pieces can move along any path and in any direction up to their maximum spaces.
- Pieces can't jump over other pieces.*
- Maximum spaces are equal to the number of sides of the piece.**

\* - This rule can be changed by applying the advanced rule 1.<br>
** - This rule can be changed by applying the advanced rule 2.

Pieces can be one of this four types:
- **Circle** - 1 side
- **Triangle** - 3 sides
- **Square** - 4 sides
- **Pentagon** - 5 sides

Figure 1 - Combat Table

The pieces can combat the opponent's pieces by moving to a tile occupied by an opposing piece.

Combat has two outcomes:
- The defending piece is captured, marked by a sword icon in Figure 1.
- Both pieces are captured, marked by a two swords crossing icon in Figure 1.

The sword and shield icon represents certain combats that can't occur in the game.<br>
Captured pieces are removed from the board and can't be used for the rest of the game.

The victory can be achieved by **capturing the opponent's pentagon** or by occupying **both gold tiles** at the **end** of the **opponent's turn**.

Two optional advanced rules can be applied to the game:
1. *Square pieces can jump over other pieces, except for opposing squares. A "jumped" tile still counts towards the piece's move limit.*
2. *Pieces that start a turn on a gold tile can move an additional space on that turn.*

## Game Logic

### Internal Game State Representation

**Board -** The board is represented by a list of Positions. Each Position is represented by 2 elements: a Piece and the Tile where the Piece is located. Each Tile consists of the coordinates (X, Y) on the board. The minimum and maximum values for the X coordinate is defined for each line, and there can only be tiles inside those limits. Finally, the board also has Gold Tiles, which are represented by the corresponding (X, Y) coordinates on the board with the predicate gold_tile.

**Player -** The game has only two players, cian and red, represented by the corresponding atoms. Cian moves first, and after each turn, the current player is changed to the other player using the other_play predicate.

The **GameState** is represented by a list with the **Board** and the **Player** at a given time in the game. The **GameState** does not contain a list of pieces that each player has captured, since they are removed from the board and can't be used for the rest of the game.

This is the representation of the board in the initial game state, where each piece is located in its starting position:
```prolog
% board(+State, -Board)
% Unifies Board with the board at the current State for starting a game or for demonstrating different board states
board(initial, 
[
    position(cian-circle-1, tile(3, 0)),
    position(cian-circle-2, tile(1, 1)),
    position(cian-square-1, tile(2, 1)),
    position(cian-triangle-1, tile(3, 1)),
    position(cian-square-2, tile(4, 1)),
    position(cian-circle-3, tile(5, 1)),
    position(cian-triangle-2, tile(2, 2)),
    position(cian-pentagon-1, tile(3, 2)),
    position(cian-triangle-3, tile(4, 2)),
    position(cian-circle-4, tile(1, 3)),
    position(cian-square-3, tile(3, 3)),
    position(cian-circle-5, tile(5, 3)),
    position(cian-circle-6, tile(3, 4)),
    position(red-circle-1, tile(3, 6)),
    position(red-circle-2, tile(1, 7)),
    position(red-triangle-1, tile(2, 7)),
    position(red-square-1, tile(3, 7)),
    position(red-triangle-2, tile(4, 7)),
    position(red-circle-3, tile(5, 7)),
    position(red-square-2, tile(2, 8)),
    position(red-pentagon-1, tile(3, 8)),
    position(red-square-3, tile(4, 8)),
    position(red-circle-4, tile(1, 9)),
    position(red-triangle-3, tile(3, 9)),
    position(red-circle-5, tile(5, 9)),
    position(red-circle-6, tile(3, 10))
]
).
```
*board.pl*

This is a possible representation of the board in an intermediate game state. The pieces are located in different positions than the initial game state, some of the pieces were captured, but no player has won yet, since both players still have their pentagon and the gold tiles ((1,5) and (5,1)) are not both occupied by the same player:

```prolog
% board(+State, -Board)
% Unifies Board with the board at the current State for starting a game or for demonstrating different board states
board(intermediate, 
[
    position(cian-circle-1, tile(4, 5)),
    position(cian-square-1, tile(5, 7)),
    position(cian-triangle-1, tile(5,2)),
    position(cian-circle-3, tile(5, 1)),
    position(cian-pentagon-1, tile(3, 0)),
    position(cian-triangle-3, tile(0, 5)),
    position(cian-circle-6, tile(5, 5)),
    position(red-circle-1, tile(3, 2)),
    position(red-square-1, tile(5, 6)),
    position(red-pentagon-1, tile(3, 5)),
    position(red-circle-4, tile(2, 3)),
    position(red-triangle-1, tile(3, 9)),
    position(red-circle-6, tile(1, 5))
]
).
```
*board.pl*

And finally, a possible representation of the board in the final game state, where the cian player has won the game by capturing the red player's pentagon:
```prolog
% board(+State, -Board)
% Unifies Board with the board at the current State for starting a game or for demonstrating different board states
board(final, 
[
    position(cian-circle-1, tile(5, 1)),
    position(cian-pentagon-1, tile(5, 6)),
    position(red-circle-1, tile(3, 5))
]
).
```
