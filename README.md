## Game Description

**Tactigon** is a board game for two players, played on a irregular hexagon board. The game is played with 13 pieces for each player. The game starts with a default board configuration, and the players take turns moving their pieces and resolving any combat that may result from that movement.

General movement rules:
- Pieces can move along any path and in any direction up to their maximum spaces.
- Pieces can't jump over other pieces.*
- Maximum spaces is equal to the number of sides of the piece.**

\* - This rule can be changed by applying the advanced rule 1.<br>
** - This rule can be changed by applying the advanced rule 2.

Pieces can be of four types:
- **Circle** - 1 side
- **Triangle** - 3 sides
- **Square** - 4 sides
- **Pentagon** - 5 sides

The pieces can combat the opponent's pieces by moving to a tile occupied by an opposing piece.

Combat has two outcomes:
- The defending piece is captured, marked by a sword icon on the Figure 1.
- Both pieces are captured, marked by a two swords crossing icon on the Figure 1.

The sword and shield icons represent certain combats that can't occur in the game.<br>
Captured pieces are removed from the board and can't be used for the rest of the game.

The victory can be achieved by **capturing the opponent's pentagon** or by occupying **both gold tiles** at the **end** of the **opponent's turn**.

Two optional advanced rules can be applied to the game:
1. *Square pieces can jump over other pieces, except for opposing squares. A "jumped" tile still counts towards the piece's move limit.*
2. *Pieces that start a turn on a gold tile can move an additional space on that turn.*
